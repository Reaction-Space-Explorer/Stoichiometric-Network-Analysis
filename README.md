## Stoichiometric Network Analysis
Stoichiometric Analysis relies on:<br>
* Linear Algebra
* Graph Theory 
* Control Theory <br>

Linear algebra might be the most important topic in order to understand the stoichiometric texture of a system. Being the fourth fundamental subpsaces extremly 
relevant to understand most types of stochiometric analysis.

Before you begin, here are Dr. Strang's lectures explaining the Fundamental Subspaces (in my opinion the best resorces to understand this topic -Ale)
